Homework (Simulation)
This section introduces lfs.py, a simple LFS simulator you can use
to understand better how an LFS-based file system works. Read the
README for details on how to run the simulator.
Questions
<br/>
<br/>

1. Run ./lfs.py -n 3, perhaps varying the seed (-s). Can you figure out which commands were run to generate the final file system
contents? Can you tell which order those commands were issued?
Finally, can you determine the liveness of each block in the final
file system state? Use -o to show which commands were run, and
-c to show the liveness of the final file system state. How much
harder does the task become for you as you increase the number of
commands issued (i.e., change -n 3 to -n 5)?
<br/>
<br/>

2. If you find the above painful, you can help yourself a little bit by
showing the set of updates caused by each specific command. To do
so, run ./lfs.py -n 3 -i. Now see if it is easier to understand
what each command must have been. Change the random seed to
get different commands to interpret (e.g., -s 1, -s 2, -s 3, etc.).
<br/>
<br/>

3. To further test your ability to figure out what updates are made to
disk by each command, run the following: ./lfs.py -o -F -s
100 (and perhaps a few other random seeds). This just shows a
set of commands and does NOT show you the final state of the file
system. Can you reason about what the final state of the file system
must be?
<br/>
<br/>

4. Now see if you can determine which files and directories are live
after a number of file and directory operations. Run tt ./lfs.py
-n 20 -s 1 and then examine the final file system state. Can you
figure out which pathnames are valid? Run tt ./lfs.py -n 20
-s 1 -c -v to see the results. Run with -o to see if your answers
match up given the series of random commands. Use different random seeds to get more problems.
<br/>
<br/>

5. Now let’s issue some specific commands. First, let’s create a file
and write to it repeatedly. To do so, use the -L flag, which lets you
specify specific commands to execute. Let’s create the file ”/foo”
and write to it four times:
-L c,/foo:w,/foo,0,1:w,/foo,1,1:w,/foo,2,1:w,/foo,3,1
-o. See if you can determine the liveness of the final file system
state; use -c to check your answers.
<br/>
<br/>

6. Now, let’s do the same thing, but with a single write operation instead of four. Run ./lfs.py -o -L c,/foo:w,/foo,0,4 to
create file ”/foo” and write 4 blocks with a single write operation.
Compute the liveness again, and check if you are right with -c.
What is the main difference between writing a file all at once (as
we do here) versus doing it one block at a time (as above)? What
does this tell you about the importance of buffering updates in main
memory as the real LFS does?
<br/>
<br/>

7. Let’s do another specific example. First, run the following: ./lfs.py
-L c,/foo:w,/foo,0,1. What does this set of commands do?
Now, run ./lfs.py -L c,/foo:w,/foo,7,1. What does this
set of commands do? How are the two different? What can you tell
about the size field in the inode from these two sets of commands?
<br/>
<br/>

8. Now let’s look explicitly at file creation versus directory creation.
Run simulations ./lfs.py -L c,/foo and ./lfs.py -L d,/foo
to create a file and then a directory. What is similar about these runs,
and what is different?
<br/>
<br/>

9. The LFS simulator supports hard links as well. Run the following
to study how they work:
./lfs.py -L c,/foo:l,/foo,/bar:l,/foo,/goo -o -i.
What blocks are written out when a hard link is created? How is
this similar to just creating a new file, and how is it different? How
does the reference count field change as links are created?
<br/>
<br/>

10. LFS makes many different policy decisions. We do not explore
many of them here – perhaps something left for the future – but here
is a simple one we do explore: the choice of inode number. First, run
./lfs.py -p c100 -n 10 -o -a s to show the usual behavior with the ”sequential” allocation policy, which tries to use free
inode numbers nearest to zero. Then, change to a ”random” policy
by running ./lfs.py -p c100 -n 10 -o -a r (the -p c100
flag ensures 100 percent of the random operations are file creations).
What on-disk differences does a random policy versus a sequential
policy result in? What does this say about the importance of choosing inode numbers in a real LFS?
<br/>
<br/>

11. One last thing we’ve been assuming is that the LFS simulator always updates the checkpoint region after each update. In the real
LFS, that isn’t the case: it is updated periodically to avoid long
seeks. Run ./lfs.py -N -i -o -s 1000 to see some operations and the intermediate and final states of the file system when
the checkpoint region isn’t forced to disk. What would happen if
the checkpoint region is never updated? What if it is updated periodically? Could you figure out how to recover the file system to the
latest state by rolling forward in the log?
